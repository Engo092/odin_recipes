# Odin recipes project 2.0

This is the improved version of the first and very basic odin project. After taking a break from programming, I decided to revisit this project to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS again, so I made it look way better than previously, integrating some functionalities i have learned ever since. Functionally, not much has changed, but it's prettier now. I also organized the project files so they are way cleaner and easier to mess with.

This project shows basic HTML abilites like linking pages, being able to put images in a page, ordered and unordered lists, and so on. There is also some basic CSS skills, with most of it being done in the last update i created for this project. I was never a fan of working with CSS, but I am getting better at it thankfully. This is a small project so it still is very basic.
