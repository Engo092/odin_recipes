# Odin recipes project

This is the first and very basic odin project. I already had previous experience with HTML and CSS so i finished it very quickly.

This project shows basic HTML abilites like linking pages, being able to put images in a page, ordered and unordered lists, and so on. There is also some CSS which i added after the initial HTML, which showcases a bit of my CSS skills (though it isn't anything spectacular).
