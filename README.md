# Odin recipes project

This is the first and very basic odin project. I already had experience with HTML and CSS so i finished it very quickly.

This project shows basic HTML abilites like linking pages, being able to put images in a page, ordered and unordered lists, and so on. No CSS was used as it isn't nedded due to being a basic project (which i'm very thankful for, since when i use CSS my sites aren't very visually pleasing).
